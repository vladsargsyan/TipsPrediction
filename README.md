# TipsPrediction

## Introduction to the project
This project aims to predict the amount of tip likely to be given to the waiter based on various factors.


## How to open an IPYNB file.

1. Clone this repository to your local machine: git clone https://github.com/vladsargsyan/craps.git
2. Install Jupyter Notebook on your workstation. Alternatively, open the application if Jupyter Notebook is already installed
3. Double-click the Tips.ipynb file in the Jupyter application. This should open the IPYNB file in a separate tab. Running each time you will get different output as the test size is 20% of the existing data.

## Output example
As the output, you can see the Scatter Linear Regression with a prediction line, a pie chart of the tips by days of the week, and finally the test accuracy and prediction.
